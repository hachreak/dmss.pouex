v0.6
 - Fix change of Feature's name in OCL rules.
 - ecore: move Pouex OCL rules in LiveObject
 - Add StateActivationCondition: new kind of Activation condition dependent of a state
 - add OCL rule ActionNameMustBeUnique to control if name is unique.
 - add OCL rule StateNameMustBeUnique to control if name is unique.
 - Rename OCL cantExistTwoFeatureWithSameName in FeatureNameMustBeUnique
 - Add Test 07_TestActionNameMustBeUnique.xmi e 08_TestStateNameMustBeUnique.xmi
 - Rename test 03_TestFeatureNameMustBeUnique.xmi in 03_TestFeatureNameMustBeUnique.xmi
 - Fix GameTest02: add a BodyPart
 - Add Test 04_TestAtLeastOneActionForEachFeature_error2.xmi to control if detect disabled actions

v0.5.1
 - Set default value for eachMillisec = 1000
 - Remove src

v0.5
 - BodyPart: add a url for a image 
 - Generalized the concept of "Live Object": now, also a body part can have features, actions and states.
 - Change name of PouexFeature to Feature

v0.4
 - Add test of OCL atLeastOneActionForEachFeature that validate.
 - OCL PouexFeature coherentValueMinDefaultMax: value must be minimum <= default <= maximum
 - Add different test (05) for OCL PouexFeature coherentValueMinDefaultMax
 - Add test for OCL CantModifyFeatureTwiceOrMore for subtype of a Action (06_TestSubTypeActionCantModifyFeatureTwiceOrMore.xmi)
 - Fix Threshold class names.
 - Update README of ecore
    

v0.3
 - Simplifying the model: include TimeEvent as a Pouex's event. Remove periodicActions in Pouex and put all inside actions.
 - Change the GameTest01.xmi accordingly.
 - Remove FeatureEvent
 - OCL atLeastOneActionForEachFeature: At least should exist one defined action that can modify each features
 

v0.2
 - OCL cantModifyFeatureTwiceOrMore: One action can't modify level of a feature twice in succession
 - OCL cantExistTwoFeatureWithSameName: Can't exist two feature with the same name.

v0.1
 - FeatureEvent: replace a threshold with optional fields minimumThreshold and maximumThreshold
 - ActivationCondition is abstract!
 - ActivationCondition: extent this type of Class with ThreasholdActivationCondition to represent activation condition with a threshold.
 - Extend ThreasholdActivationCondition with ActivationConditionMinThreashold (if you reach a minimum level), ActivationConditionMaxThreashold (if you reach a minimum level)
 - Rename FeatureType in InfluenceType: to be used also in other context
 - Influence: add operator and value.
 - Change: instead use Integer, use a much generic Double
 - Can remove Feature Event?
 - PouexFeature: change name of attribute "initial" to "default"
 - Created a "RepeatedAction" like a subclass of Action and ancestor of TimeEvent and PeriodicPouexAction
 - Action: add a enum ActionStatus to define the current status.
 - Pouex: add periodic actions
 - Add model/test where put examples to test OCL rules 
 - Add First OCL rule to test Pouex name
