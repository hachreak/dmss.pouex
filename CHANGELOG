 - add OCL rule StateNameMustBeUnique to control if name is unique.

 - Add Test 07_TestActionNameMustBeUnique.xmi e 08_TestStateNameMustBeUnique.xmi

 - Add Test 04_TestAtLeastOneActionForEachFeature_error2.xmi to control if detect disabled actions

v0.5.1
 - Set default value for eachMillisec = 1000

v0.5

 - Generalized the concept of "Live Object": now, also a body part can have features, actions and states.
 - Change name of PouexFeature to Feature

v0.4
 - Add test of OCL atLeastOneActionForEachFeature that validate.
 - OCL PouexFeature coherentValueMinDefaultMax: value must be minimum <= default <= maximum
 - Add different test (05) for OCL PouexFeature coherentValueMinDefaultMax
 - Add test for OCL CantModifyFeatureTwiceOrMore for subtype of a Action (06_TestSubTypeActionCantModifyFeatureTwiceOrMore.xmi)
 - Fix Threshold class names.
 - Update README of ecore
    

v0.3
 - Simplifying the model: include TimeEvent as a Pouex's event. Remove periodicActions in Pouex and put all inside actions.
 - Change the GameTest01.xmi accordingly.
 - Remove FeatureEvent
 - OCL atLeastOneActionForEachFeature: At least should exist one defined action that can modify each features
 

v0.2
 - OCL cantModifyFeatureTwiceOrMore: One action can't modify level of a feature twice in succession
 - OCL cantExistTwoFeatureWithSameName: Can't exist two feature with the same name.

v0.1
 - FeatureEvent: replace a threshold with optional fields minimumThreshold and maximumThreshold
 - ActivationCondition is abstract!
 - ActivationCondition: extent this type of Class with ThreasholdActivationCondition to represent activation condition with a threshold.
