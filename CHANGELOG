 - OCL PouexFeature coherentValueMinDefaultMax: value must be minimum <= default <= maximum
 - Add different test (05) for OCL PouexFeature coherentValueMinDefaultMax
 - Add test for OCL CantModifyFeatureTwiceOrMore for subtype of a Action (06_TestSubTypeActionCantModifyFeatureTwiceOrMore.xmi)
 - Fix Threshold class names.
 - Update README of ecore
    

v0.3
